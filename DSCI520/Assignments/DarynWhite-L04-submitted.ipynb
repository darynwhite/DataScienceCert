    "# Assignment\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, we implement a simulation for estimating profit made at a sandwich shop. Not suprisingly, the sandwich shop earns money every time a customer buys a sandwich. However, the inputs to the sandwich cost money. The daily profit is the amount customers pay for the sandwiches minus the cost of the inputs. Unlike the simulations we saw in class, this time we need to set up simulations for multiple dependent events, so we worked out some of the solution and leave you to fill in the gaps as pointed out in the assignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem statement\n",
    "\n",
    "To keep things simple, we make the following assumptions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The shop bakes its own bread, and the bread must be used on the day it is made. The customers can select one of three types of bread, white, wheat, and multigrain.\n",
    "- The number of each type of bread baked in the sandwich shop is fixed. Presumably the shop manager has a plan for the day, and the bread is baked in advance of the customer arrivals.\n",
    "- The probability that each customer chooses a particular type of bread is fixed and known. There probabilities are 50% for white bread, 25% for wheat and 25% for multigrain. \n",
    "- If a customer's choice of bread is not available the customer leaves the shop without buying a sandwich.\n",
    "- The only perishable input which must be discarded at the end of each day is the bread. \n",
    "- Customers do NOT stop coming to the sandwich shop as a result of not finding their bread choice. In other words, we will not consider the possiblity of attrition.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to develop an overall profitability model we must run through the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Simulate the number of customer arrivals on a given day.\n",
    "1. Simulate supply and demand for each bread. Supply will be deterministic, but demand will depend on the number of customers who come on a given day and which type of bread they choose. \n",
    "1. Once we have supply and demand, we can finally simulate profit. \n",
    "\n",
    "Running the above simulation over many iterations will give us a distribution for daily profit. We can use this distribution to answer all sorts of questions about profitability. To help you better visualize the process, here's a flowchart that you can refer back to as you work on the assignment. \n",

    "## Setting up the simulation\n",
    "\n",
    "We begin by writing a function called `daily_demand`, which will simulate how many of each bread customers will demand given the number of customers who walked in on a given day. To do so, we use the **multi-nomial distribution**, an extension of the binomial distribution that allows more than just two (binary) outcomes. We have 3 choices of bread in this case, each having a probability $p_i$ of occuring, where $p_i$ is fixed. How did we know to use the the multi-nomial distribution and not some other distribution? The answer to that is we made an educated guess based on (1) domain knowledge, and (2) knowledge of probability distributions. Of course we may be wrong about our choice, so when we're unsure it may be a good idea to also test other distributions, but we will stick with the multi-nomial distribution."
