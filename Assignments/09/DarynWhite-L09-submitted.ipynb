    "We saw a few examples of machine learning algorithms, so at this point it seems like once you get the data ready, machine learning is just \"plug and play\", but not so fast! \n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, we learn about **regularization**! Regularization is a means by which we can control how much a machine learning algorithm learns. The controlling is done using a parameter that the algorithm, called the **shrinkage parameter**, which is just an argument of the algorithm. The shrinkage parameter is an example of a **hyper-parameter**. A hyper-parameter is like a knob: by specifying a different value for the hyper-parameter, we control how the training happens, a process called **hyper-parameter tuning**. We talk about this is more detail in the next lesson.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will look at two examples of regularizaiton: LASSO and Ridge regression. Both LASSO and Ridge regression are implementations of linear regression where we try to minimize prediction error plus some penalty that depends on the model's parameters (or coefficients) and the shrinkage constant (`alpha` in the code below). LASSO penalizes the model's parameters using the sum of the **absolute values** of the parameters (this is also called **L1-regularization**), while Ridge does so based on the sum of the **squared values** of the parameters (this is also called **L2-regularization**). For reasons we cannot elaborate on here, **LASSO has the by-product that it also does feature selection**, whereas Ridge doesn't. So not all regularization results in feature selection."

Instead of accuracy, the primary measure is **Root Mean Squared Error** (**RMSE**).  A **RMSE** of zero occurs when the predictions are perfect. **RMSE** increases as the predictions get worse.
