    "If you're not familiar with the term **method** it refers to the fact that once you create an object, there are certain functions that you can call that are relevant to the object. For example, a set has a method called `difference` so that you can take the difference of one set from another set. To call the method, you type the name of the object itself, followed by a period, and the name of the method. Tab completion can help you find out what all methods an object might have. Similarly, on more sophisticated editors like Visual Studio Code, we can use intellisense to quickly view the methods and attributes of an object and even pull up their definitions. Finally, we can also call the `dir` function in Python for this. In the below example, notice how we drop methods that start with a double underscore (called \"dunder\" by Pythonistas) as these are the internal methods and we should avoid using them. A deeper discussion of this is out of the scope of this lesson."

    "So let's summarize what we accomplished:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We read data from a JSON file into a Python dictionary.\n",
    "1. We extracted some of the data out of the Python dictionary and placed it into a list of tuples.\n",
    "1. We took the list of tuples and dumped its content into a SQL table.\n",
    "1. We read the content back from the SQL table and into Python as a list of tuples.\n",
    "\n",
    "As data flows from one format to another, it's important to think about the right object for representing the data. The right choice depends on many factors, such as\n",
    "\n",
    "- The size of the data and other efficiency factors\n",
    "- Whether the data is flat or hierarchical\n",
    "- Whether the data is structured, unstructured, or semi-structured\n",
    "- Our preference for how to \"query\" the data\n",
    "\n",
    "Working with data, especially at scale, is such an important topic in data science that a relative new role, called **data engineer**, was created to deal with this. Among other things, data engineers work on creating efficient data pipelines to reduce redundancy, and letting the right tools do the job."

    "In this assignment we want to get comfortable with loading and manipulating data in Python. While future assignments will focus more using structured data which we can load into a `DataFrame` using `pandas`, this assignment is focused on semi-structured data and how we can \"flatten\" it and then load it into other formats. The objective is to see how data flows in Python from one object to another and what advantages and disadvantages each offers.\n",
